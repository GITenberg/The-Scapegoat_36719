<h1>THE SCAPEGOAT</h1>

<h2>By RICHARD MAPLES</h2>

<div class="center blockquote"><i>Who would not have pity for
a poor, helpless victim? Nobody
&mdash;except another poor victim!</i></div>
<div class="center extraspacetop extraspacebot">Illustrated by WEISS</div>


<div class="cap">THE OLD GUY didn't have
a chance. All he could do
was shield his head with
limp arms and moan, while this
other fellow&mdash;a young, husky
six-footer&mdash;gave him a vicious,
cold-blooded beating.</div>

<p>"Hey, there!" I yelled indignantly.
"Cut it out!"</p>

<p>But the kid kept belting away,
as if he were methodically working
out on a fifty-pound training
bag. Finally, the old man sagged
to the pavement. Then this hoodlum
began to kick him.</p>

<p>I'm not a hero. I'm a newspaper
man whose job it is to look
at things objectively. But I know
right from wrong.</p>

<p>My one punch caught the
young bruiser back of the ear
and spilled him on the ground.
He lay there for a moment, then
rolled over. Even by the street
light, it was easy to see his eyes
were glassy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>It gave me lots of satisfaction.
I'm not a big man&mdash;just compact&mdash;but
I take care of myself.
I don't drink or smoke and I
exercise regularly. The result is
I can handle myself in the
clinches.</p>

<p>The kid sat up and pushed
himself unsteadily to his feet. I
could see now that he was a college
boy. The red sweater with
the terrycloth border and the
white pants with a shortened
left leg were a dead giveaway.</p>

<p>"Listen here," I said roughly,
"you nuts? Beating up an old
man!"</p>

<p>He appeared to be desperately
searching for an explanation&mdash;something
to say. Then, abruptly,
without having uttered a sound,
he reeled away and shambled
hurriedly down the street.</p>

<p>My first inclination was to
give chase. But the old man
groaned and I turned to help
him. That was when I had it&mdash;a
virtual brain storm.</p>

<p>This whole episode, I could
see, was a perfect answer to the
damnable criticisms leveled at
my series on juvenile delinquency.
More than that, it was
an absolute vindication!</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<div class="cap">BARELY AN hour ago, I'd had
to sit at a meeting and take
it on the chin from twenty of
the town's leading lights who
designated themselves The Committee
for the Protection of
Youth. The outfit was, of course,
politically inspired. It had obviously
been started by the Mayor
and his gang as a means of torpedoing
Jones, the publisher of
my paper. Jones, you see, had
become politically ambitious himself.</div>

<p>Since I was the star on Jones'
team, they piled on me. Some of
the nicer things said about my
articles were that they constituted
filthy muckraking, were a
pattern of irresponsible lies, and
were designed principally to
smear the incumbent politicos.
The children of the town, they
cried, were being sacrificed to
ruthless ambition.</p>

<p>It wouldn't have been so bad
if Jones had stuck by me. But he
cut and ran. Discretion, he had
whispered to me from behind a
pudgy hand, was the better part
of valor. Then he told them he
would discontinue the articles.</p>

<p>Now I had first-hand proof of
a particularly brutal bit of delinquency.
A cruel assault on a poor,
helpless old man! Furthermore,
I was the hero of the incident!</p>

<p>Bending down to see how seriously
the old man had been hurt,
I asked, "What happened, Pop?
Was he trying to rob you or
something?" He didn't answer.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/png03_1.jpg" width="400" height="565" alt="" title="" /></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>

I looked around for help, but
the street was deserted. The best
thing, I decided, was to take him
home. There Nan, my wife, could
patch him up while I found out
what had happened. I bent down
again and pulled him to his feet.
He staggered. I put one steadying
hand on his shoulder and
gripped his wrist with the other.
My spine went cold.</p>

<p>It was his flesh. Not so much
that it felt like rubber&mdash;but the
chill. Here we were in the middle
of a heat wave, the thermometer
nudging ninety, and the old guy's
wrist is like an icicle!</p>

<p>For a second, it threw me.
Then I thought of shock. That
might explain it. And Nan, having
been a nurse, would be the one
to know.</p>

<p>I started the old man walking.
"See if you can make it to my
house," I urged. "It's just around
the corner."</p>

<p>Nan switched on the porch
light when she heard us on the
steps. Opening the door, she drew
back with a little shriek. The old
man was pretty gruesome-looking
at that. But it wasn't just his
blood-covered face and matted
white beard.</p>

<p>There was something spiderish
about him. He was angular, and
dark, and skeletal. His eyes, deep-set
and brooding, seemed to
crouch under his shaggy, jutting
brows.</p>

<p>"Take it easy, honey," I said.
"The old guy just needs some
patching up."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<div class="cap">SHE RECOVERED quickly
and helped him into the
house. After we'd eased him into
the easy chair by the fireplace
in the living room, she turned
to me, worried. "Were you in an
accident?"</div>

<p>I gave her the story and she
looked at me sharply, but didn't
speak. She went into the bedroom
and came back with blankets
and medicine bottles. Tucking
the blankets around the old
man's legs, she said, "But I don't
understand why you were walking.
You went to the meeting in
Jones' car. Why didn't he bring
you back?"</p>

<p>I didn't answer. The old man
had closed his eyes and his
breathing was becoming very
shallow. "Look at him," I said.
"Is he all right?"</p>

<p>"He's sleeping. Why don't you
answer my question?"</p>

<p>"Jones didn't bring me home
because I had words with him
and walked away in a huff."</p>

<p>"Over the meeting?"</p>

<p>"Partly." I explained about the
meeting and how Jones had back-tracked
when the going got rough.
"After all, it was his idea to build
circulation with sensational articles
and to use them to attack
the present administration. But
when there's a showdown, he acts
like a scared rabbit. And that's
what I told him."</p>

<p>"I'm glad," Nan said, her face<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
brightening. "What did he say to
that?"</p>

<p>"He gave me a lot of bull about
it being a mistake to pick on people's
children and how we should
stick to old standbys like red-light
districts and dope trafficking."</p>

<p>Nan slapped the iodine on the
table. "Some nerve! What did
you tell him?"</p>

<p>"I told him he was jerking the
rug from under me and that I'd
be damned if I'd write a bunch
of warmed-over tripe. Then I
walked away."</p>

<p>"You finally quit!"</p>

<p>Until then, I don't think I'd
ever realized just how much Nan
hated my work. Of course, off
and on, we'd really had some
knock-down drag-outs, but I'd
never considered them serious.
Oh, we often talked about my
going into teaching physical ed.
It had been my intention ever
since college. Some day I'd actually
do it.</p>

<p>I shook my head. "No, honey,
I didn't quit."</p>

<p>"But you're going to?"</p>

<p>I shrugged in a gesture of helplessness.
"How can I? An unprovoked
attack against a poor old
man is dynamite. It puts me in
the driver's seat. I can write an
article that will make every
mealy-mouthed hypocrite who
spoke against me tonight eat his
words."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<div class="cap">THE FIRE in her eyes died.
"It's always something," she
said wearily. "Year after year,
you've come up with one reason
or another to stay in the rotten
business. And what does it
amount to? Mud-slinging! I'm beginning
to think you like it!"</div>

<p>She'd never come out so bluntly
and, deep down, I felt my resentment
pressing like the sharp
edge of a coiled spring. Originally,
getting into the newspaper
game had been a sort of fluke.
Majoring in physical ed at college,
I often covered the various
sports events for the campus
paper. One day, a big-time scandal
broke, involving gamblers
and one of the teams, and I
found myself in a perfect spot
to do an exclusive for a city
paper. My stuff was run verbatim
under a by-line and afterward
picked up by the wire services.</p>

<p>Later, with a trick knee keeping
me out of the war, I managed
to talk myself into a job with
the newspaper that had run my
expose. I was goaded by a feeling
that I ought to be doing something
bigger than teaching children
how to play games.</p>

<p>From the very start, I discovered
I had a peculiar talent. If
I found myself anywhere near a
skeleton in a closet, I could plainly
hear its rattle. Before long,
my reputation was firmly established.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>Nan, whom I'd met at college,
knew of my ambition to teach
and began planning toward that
end as soon as we married. She
started what she called a quitting
fund. This was to stake a move
to a small town where her uncle
was principal of the high school.
He was supposed to help me get
a foothold in the new career.</p>

<p>But then Tommy was born and
there were bills to pay. After that
there were other reasons, like car
payments. By the end of the war,
the teaching plans were no longer
discussed, and Nan and I had
drawn so far apart that even the
bickering between us had ceased.</p>

<p>Finally, when Tommy was
about ten, she suddenly let me
have it.</p>

<p>It seems the kid was running
around with a tough crowd. She
wanted to get him away from the
city. He needed the fresh air and
the decent, normal home-life of
a small town, she said. And she
meant every word of it.</p>

<p>Luckily, Jones had come along
right about then and offered me
a job on his newspaper, back in
the old home town. He had an
idea he could drive the opposition
paper out of business by featuring
yellow journalism at the local
level. That's where I came in.
With my ability to make the
news bleed, he figured he could
cinch it. For that reason, he was
willing to double my present salary.
So I accepted.</p>

<p>Nan, of course, was furious,
even though I pointed out the
extra dough meant we could start
planning again. She didn't calm
down until I promised to quit the
job after six months.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<div class="cap">YES, IT WAS always something.
She was right enough
about that. But she had no right
to make such an issue of things.
I started to tell her that, then
stopped. Maybe she was picking
a quarrel to make me forget
about the old man and the story.
I threw a fast block into my resentment.</div>

<p>"Honey," I said, "don't be unreasonable.
Remember this job
with Jones was supposed to get
Tommy away from the city, and
the extra dough was all part of
that big plan for the teaching
business."</p>

<p>"What plan?" she flared.
"There never was a plan except
to pamper your vanity! Big-shot
Potter, the whiz-bang newspaperman!
That's all you've ever been
interested in!"</p>

<p>I had to take a deep breath
to keep from yelling back at her.
"You're not being very fair about
this. I did it all with you and
Tommy in mind."</p>

<p>Her voice lowered. "Is that so?
Well, how about the promise to
quit in six months? We've saved
the money. What marvelous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
thing do you have in mind for
me and Tommy now?"</p>

<p>That <i>hurt</i>. As a matter of fact,
I'd been quite enjoying the stint
with Jones. My series on juvenile
delinquency had just about
doubled circulation and that gave
me a deep sense of accomplishment.
Then, too, writing the stuff
against the Mayor and the rest
of the town's big-wigs&mdash;in keeping
with Jones' political ambitions&mdash;nurtured
a feeling of
power that was very satisfying.</p>

<p>Frankly, the meeting earlier
that evening had set me down
harder than I cared to admit.
Now, with every chance for a
comeback, Nan wanted me to
pass!</p>

<p>"Listen," I snarled, "so it's hot.
So don't take it out on me!"</p>

<p>Her fists bunched and the color
drained from her face. Knowing
the signs, I could tell this was
going to be a lulu.</p>

<p>But the door flew open and
Tommy came clomping through
the hallway and into the front
room. He's a big kid for his age,
mentally and physically. He
spotted the old man right away.</p>

<p>"Gol<i>lee</i>!" he breathed excitedly.
"Who's the creep?"</p>

<p>"Never mind," Nan said, quickly
recovering her composure.
"He's had an accident. Just get
some money from your father
and go to the drugstore for more
bandages. I'll need them."</p>

<p>I gave him a buck and he ran
out the kitchen way, slamming
the back door so hard, the whole
house shook.</p>

<p>The old man's eyes flickered
open. He looked at me first, then
at Nan. "Well," he said in a
peculiar muffled tone that suggested
he was speaking through
an obstruction like a fencing
mask, "isn't this cozy!"</p>

<p>I immediately threw a lot of
questions at him. His name, he
said, was Ashe&mdash;just plain Ashe.
He couldn't remember any other
name. He couldn't remember
why he'd been beaten up, nor
what had led up to it. He was
very confused. He thought maybe
it would all come back to him
later. However, he did remember
my rescuing him and he appreciated
that very much. Hearing
him say so gave me a nice, tingling
glow. I invited him to stay
for dinner and he accepted.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<div class="cap">NAN objected. "There's only
salad," she wailed. "It was
too hot to cook."</div>

<p>"Salad's fine," I told her.</p>

<p>"Oh, Ted, please!"</p>

<p>"Listen here," I said coldly,
"I've invited Ashe to stay and
he's accepted. Why all the fuss?"</p>

<p>She gave me a hurt look,
turned, flounced into the kitchen.
I started to follow, thinking I'd
made a mistake in being so
brusque. Then I thought, the heck<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
with it. Let her take it any way
she wanted.</p>

<p>Sweat was plastering my shirt
and pants to me like a skindiver's
outfit. I needed a shower. I told
Ashe to rest easy and went into
the bathroom.</p>

<p>When I came out, Tommy had
returned. He and the old man
were busily gabbing. Nan, standing
by the kitchen door, frantically
signaled me to join her. In
the kitchen, she backed me
against the sink. "Get him out
of here!"</p>

<p>"Why?" I asked, startled.</p>

<p>"There's something wrong with
him."</p>

<p>"Wrong?"</p>

<p>"He gives me the willies."</p>

<p>"It's just the heat," I scoffed.</p>

<p>"If you must know, he&mdash;he
leered at me! While you were in
the shower. It was awful!"</p>

<p>"Nan, do you think that kind
of yarn is going to stop me from
writing about what happened tonight?
It won't. And you can
make up your mind I'm keeping
the job. When I get through with
the people in this town, they'll
know they've been dealing with
Edward Potter!"</p>

<p>Tight-lipped, she went to the
refrigerator for the supper.</p>

<p>As soon as we'd sat down, Ashe
began to talk. He kept it up
through the entire meal. He'd
been everywhere and done everything,
to hear him tell it. Tommy,
listening bug-eyed, kept asking
questions. It sort of got me. The
hero of the affair, to my own son,
was Ashe!</p>

<p>It was Nan who finally blew
the whistle.</p>

<p>"Mr. Ashe," she said, her voice
honed to a razor-edge, "I'm sure
Ted would be much more interested
in knowing what led up to
the fight tonight&mdash;or are you
still confused?"</p>

<p>There was a beat of three
while he studied Nan carefully.
Then he said, "It's quite apparent,
Mrs. Potter, that you've absolutely
no use for me. This shows discernment.
Most likely, with a
woman's instinct, you've hit upon
at least part of the truth. Because
of that, it might be wise to lay
all my cards on the table. But I
warn you, it will be hard to believe."</p>

<p>"That," said Nan, leaning back
with a gleam of triumph in her
eyes, "I'll bet on!"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<div class="cap">IT WAS hard to believe, all
right. So hard, in fact, that I
thought he was just pulling Nan's
leg.</div>

<p>He said he'd come from another
world, outside our solar
system, where people existed in
a kind of liquid state, bouncing
about, for the most part, like
large water-filled bladders. They
were, however, capable of taking
almost any shape their superior<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
minds willed. They could flatten
and drift about in the water, or
they could inflate and rise in the
air. They could even become facsimiles
of other living things, taking
on the shape, texture and
coloration, a capability which
aided greatly in their main function
of traveling as missionaries
of goodness amongst the peoples
of the Galaxy. For they were perfect&mdash;as
perfect as angels.</p>

<p>As he talked, Nan's face got
redder and redder. Finally, when
I couldn't keep from snickering,
she jumped up, grabbed her
empty plate and headed for the
kitchen.</p>

<p>"Don't rush off, honey," I said
innocently.</p>

<p>She stopped at the kitchen
door and glared at me. "I guess
I know when I'm being kidded!"</p>

<p>"But," said Ashe in his cold,
dry purr, "I'm not kidding."</p>

<p>It seemed to me the joke had
gone far enough. "Don't tell me,"
I said sarcastically, "that you're
a missionary to Earth!"</p>

<p>"No," he admitted. "I'm here
because I was banished."</p>

<p>"Oh. A sort of fallen angel!"</p>

<p>"Exactly."</p>

<p>Another chill scurried along
my spine. It was his tone of voice
more than anything. But then,
too, his eyes had a dull, black
humorlessness about them.</p>

<p>Nan returned to the table and
sat down. I noticed a band of
perspiration mustaching her upper
lip. Indeed, I seemed to have
grown much hotter myself.</p>

<p>Irritably, I said, "Ashe, it's too
damn warm for games. If you
don't want to explain what happened
this evening, that's your
privilege. But, as you know, the
story means a lot to me. And I
did stick my neck out for you!"</p>

<p>He held up a gnarled hand.
"One moment, my boy. Let me
finish."</p>

<p>So he finished. And the rest of
the story was even nuttier.</p>

<p>He was a throwback, he said
with quiet pride. The perfection
which had taken his people countless
years to attain was wiped
out the moment he came into
being. They'd tried to reform him,
but there was something fundamental
about his evil&mdash;as if it
were an essence.</p>

<p>As a last resort, they'd put
him into one of their wonderful
machines and thrown the switch.
At that agonizing instant, he'd
imagined himself to be water
scraping over the edge of a sharp
rock. Then he'd come to, drifting
through space. And, much later,
he'd touched Earth. Once landed,
he'd taken on many shapes,
through the years&mdash;mainly,
however, of people who'd died.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<div class="cap">EVEN AS HE talked, I was
carefully sliding my chair
back. If I could reach the phone<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
in the hallway without being noticed,
it would be fairly simple
to get help. But he saw what I
was doing and laughed.</div>

<p>"Edward," he said, "I know
you don't believe me, but stick
around until I prove it."</p>

<p>What happened next almost
made me sick to my stomach.
His face, which had been as
wrinkled as a fielder's mitt, all
of a sudden took on the appearance
of a disturbed reflection in
a pool of water. His flesh began
to writhe like a tangled mass of
earthworms. Thirty seconds after
it began, he'd sloughed off thirty
years. Even his beard, which had
been as white as shower-room
tiling, became a fierce, dead black.</p>

<p>I heard Tommy pipe, "Gol<i>lee</i>!"
and Nan sigh&mdash;only it
sounded more like a groan. I
shook away the dazed feeling and
it was immediately replaced by
a great excitement.</p>

<p>"Listen here," I said hoarsely,
"this story will set the whole
country on its ear. With my by-line
on it!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Ted," Nan cried, "don't
let him take you in! It's a trick.
It's&mdash;it's mass hypnotism or
something."</p>

<p>"The trouble with you," I said,
"is you don't believe even what
you see with your own eyes!"</p>

<p>The next day, I went to see
Jones. We'd decided&mdash;Ashe and
I&mdash;upon a course of action. The
existence of Ashe was to remain
a secret, but I was to keep my job
with the paper at all costs. Then
we could sit back and wait for
the opportune moment to spill it,
a time when we had the best
angle and were positive Ashe
wouldn't be labeled a hoax.</p>

<p>Driving to the plant, I was
tense enough to snap. It was not
entirely from the unabated heat,
either. I didn't like the way Ashe
had acted during the latter part
of the evening.</p>

<p>Naturally I had felt disappointment
at not being able to reveal
his presence. But what rankled
most was the guy's colossal gall.
Okay, so I'm childish, only I just
don't like to have someone gobble
up my share of the dessert.</p>

<p>He'd also borrowed all the cash
in the house and then demanded
I draw on my bank account. I
quickly discouraged that. But the
topper was his forcing Nan and
me to sleep on the couch while
he used the bed. He said his
bruises still hurt, even though
they weren't visible.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<div class="cap">MY MOOD didn't improve
when Jones kept me waiting
for over an hour. Surprisingly
enough, he was in good spirits.
As I entered the office, he indicated
one of the leather chairs
and said with a laugh, "Sit down,
Ted. I've got some good news."</div>

<p>My opinion of him the previous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
evening obviously hadn't
been taken very much to heart.
Sourly, I told him, "As a publisher,
you should know that good
news is no news."</p>

<p>The smile left his face. Then,
with a visible effort, he forced it
back. "You have something there,
Ted. You certainly have. But
point of view is important, also.
You see, they've arrested a gang
of kids for shoplifting. One of
them is Tommy, your son."</p>

<p>I jumped up. "Arrested Tommy!"</p>

<p>"Now wait, Ted. Don't go off
half-cocked. It's a break. Don't
you see? You can cover delinquency
with the lid off now.
You'll be writing as a parent in
the same boat with other
parents...."</p>

<p>I could still hear his frantic
noises after I'd slammed the door
behind me and run the length of
the corridor.</p>

<p>At the police station, I had the
distinct feeling they'd been waiting
for me. I knew most of them,
especially the big red-headed guy
who beckoned me into a rear
office. His name was Thompson&mdash;Detective
Emanuel Thompson.
He always looked as if he
wore a football uniform under
his dark blue suit. My articles
had roasted him plenty. He
handled juvenile delinquency
cases.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Potter," he greeted
me, smiling tightly, "we meet under
unfortunate circumstances."</p>

<p>"Can the phony sympathy," I
said. "You're not the type. Just
let me see my boy."</p>

<p>He used a red-and-blue handkerchief
to wipe the dampness
from his beefy neck. "I think we'd
better have a little talk first."</p>

<p>"I got no talking to do. This
is a lousy frame-up against me
and the paper. Get my son out
here and do it fast!"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<div class="cap">HE put the handkerchief away,
sighed and reached for the
phone.</div>

<p>It really got me when Tommy
came into the room. He'd been
crying; his face was streaked, and
he looked scared and forlorn.</p>

<p>"Son," I said, finding it difficult
to keep the rasp out of my
voice, "if you've got a hat, put
it on and let's go."</p>

<p>Thompson pulled out his handkerchief
again and carefully lowered
himself into the chair behind
the desk. "You don't seem to
understand, Mr. Potter. Your boy
is in trouble. He's been identified
as leading a gang of kids who
spent most of the morning shoplifting
in stores all over town."</p>

<p>"That's bull," I said. "How
could my boy do a thing like
that? He's only twelve. Who identified
him, anyway?"</p>

<p>"The shopkeepers and the
other members of the gang."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<div class="cap">FOR ONE awful moment, I
felt a great cavity of doubt.
"Son," I asked, "what's this all
about?"</div>

<p>Tommy's face creased with
fear and tears brimmed his eyes.
"It was Ashe," he quavered.</p>

<p>"Ashe?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I told him about the
gang."</p>

<p>"Gang?"</p>

<p>"The Red Skulls."</p>

<p>"What the heck are you talking
about?"</p>

<p>"Some of the fellows got together
and built a hut for a club-house
over on the garbage dump.
We call ourselves the Red Skulls.
I was made leader. I'm called
the Skull Cap."</p>

<p>"Why haven't I heard about
this?"</p>

<p>"You never asked, Dad. I tried
to tell you one night, but you
were hurrying to get to that road-house
on the turnpike. You said
you had a big lead on juvenile
delinquency."</p>

<p>"Well, you certainly didn't try
very hard," I said angrily. "What
was this gang's purpose?"</p>

<p>"Oh, different things. One of
the fellows has a .22 and we
hunt rats. Then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Go on."</p>

<p>"That's all."</p>

<p>"You started to say something
else."</p>

<p>He kicked at the floor. "Aw,
gee!"</p>

<p>"Let's have it!"</p>

<p>"We smoked."</p>

<p>"Smoked!"</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"And what else?"</p>

<p>"That's all. Honest!"</p>

<p>Thompson said, "What about
shoplifting?"</p>

<p>"No," sniveled Tommy. "That
was Ashe. He wanted me to talk
the gang into shoplifting, but I
wouldn't. Then he changed himself
to look like me and talked
the fellows into it when I wasn't
around. I only know about it
because I ran into them after
they'd been in a store...."</p>

<p>Thompson gave me a funny
look. "Who's this Ashe he keeps
talking about?"</p>

<p>I started to tell him. Then I
got a sudden mental flash of how
idiotic it would all sound. "The
boy," I said evenly, "is beside
himself because of all he's been
through. It's time to call a halt
to this farce. I'm going to hire
myself some legal talent."</p>

<p>He shrugged. "Suit yourself."</p>

<p>Tommy grabbed my arm and
cried, "Please don't leave me,
Dad!"</p>

<p>I pulled away from him, feeling
as if I'd dropped him off a
cliff.</p>

<p>Right outside the station, I met
Nan. She was pale and breathless.
Jones had phoned the news.
She wanted to go to Tommy
immediately.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>I guided her to the car and
pushed her inside. "Listen here,"
I said tensely, "for once, don't
make a fuss. Just help me find
Ashe. He's the one who can free
Tommy."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<div class="cap">SHE BEGAN to laugh. "That's
a hot one!" she gasped.
"That's really a hot one!"</div>

<p>I shook her, thinking she was
hysterical.</p>

<p>She stopped laughing and
swallowed hard. "Ashe is home."</p>

<p>"Home?"</p>

<p>"Blind drunk, with a blonde on
his knee."</p>

<p>I tramped so hard on the accelerator
that it must have
scraped the ground all the way
home. Ashe didn't hear me pull
up to the house because the radio
was going full blast. I hit the
light switch in the hallway and
the brightness flared against the
lengthening afternoon shadows,
spotting him and the blonde on
the living room couch.</p>

<p>The blonde looked as if she'd
come from a burlesque runway.
Ashe dumped her on the floor
and staggered to his feet. He'd
changed his appearance again.
Now he looked a strikingly handsome
twenty-five. He came forward
to throw a heavy arm
around my shoulder.</p>

<p>"Glad to see you, Ted," he
mouthed. "Ran out of money.
Must have more. Small loan...."</p>

<p>I put both hands on his chest
and pushed. He stumbled back
and thudded against the wall.
"The police have picked up
Tommy," I said flatly. "He's been
charged with the shoplifting you
did today."</p>

<p>He sobered instantly. He
jerked the blonde to her feet,
booted her out, slammed the door
and came back to me. "Ted, I'm
shocked to hear this. Tell me
about it quickly. We must do
something right away."</p>

<p>The blonde had begun to howl
and scream curses. I could hear
doors and windows opening all
the way down the street. "You
monster!" Nan spat, and hurried
outside. Presently the girl quieted
down.</p>

<p>"Ted," Ashe whispered, "I'm
ashamed of myself. Here you befriended
me and all I've done is
get you and your family in
trouble." He held a cupped hand
over his eyes as if he were shading
tears. "Can you possibly find
it in your heart to forgive me?"</p>

<p>I was moved. After all, a poor,
homeless alien being couldn't
very well be expected to understand
our manners and feelings.
Yet this one did. All because he'd
been touched by my friendship.</p>

<p>"Ashe," I said, feeling the
the warmth of good will, "I'm
happy to hear you say that. Bygones
are bygones. The important
thing is springing Tommy."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>"Exactly," he said. "We'll go
and explain everything to the
police. But we'll do it in grand
style. This is your big show. We
must have Jones and the Mayor.
We must have photographers, reporters,
television, radio&mdash;everything!"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<div class="cap">NAN RETURNED. "The girl
will be all right. She was just
upset."</div>

<p>"Honey," I told her excitedly,
"we're about to stand the whole
country on its collective ear.
Ashe is going to reveal his identity!"</p>

<p>Nan's face pinched into a look
of disgust. "You mean you're
trusting this&mdash;this creature
again?"</p>

<p>"Sure, honey. Anyone can
make a mistake."</p>

<p>"That's right!" she exploded.
"You're making one now! Oh,
Ted, stop being such a fool!"</p>

<p>"Listen here," I said, "this is
the last two minutes of the game.
We're trying to score before the
gun&mdash;and you start an argument!"</p>

<p>She began to blubber.</p>

<p>Why must she always be so
unreasonable? Why the constant
bickering and tension and unhappiness?
I was sick to death of it.
I grabbed Ashe's arm. "Come on,"
I said, "let's go."</p>

<p>Even outdoors, the air felt hot
and clammy. I headed the car
for the plant, figuring I could do
my phoning from there as well
as pick a crew. But on Main
Street, Ashe spotted a cab and
made me stop.</p>

<p>He said he'd better go on
ahead. He thought things would
work smoother that way. He
could start the ball rolling on
the release of Tommy, and I
wouldn't be held up by having
to tell people who he was.</p>

<p>I drove on alone. But it was
a mistake. People simply didn't
believe my story about an alien
being. In various ways and tones
of voice, they all suggested I go
home and sleep it off. In desperation,
I went up to Jones' house,
even though he'd already told
me on the phone that he was in
the middle of a dinner party.</p>

<p>He came up close to me and
sniffed my breath.</p>

<p>"Don't worry," I told him. "I
never touch it. But maybe I
should smell yours. Anyone who
turns his back on the biggest
story of all time must be drunk!"</p>

<p>He jerked the cigar from his
mouth and gave me a narrow-eyed,
searching look. "Ted, I just
hope for your sake this isn't
some kind of a joke."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<div class="cap">FIFTEEN minutes later, we
pulled up to the police station
in a three car convoy, with
a big crew from the paper. I led
the group inside, feeling the excitement<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
grow in me. I marched
up to the desk sergeant. "Where
is he?"</div>

<p>The desk sergeant looked
startled. "Who?"</p>

<p>Well, he wasn't there. He just
wasn't there! It was like getting
tackled two yards from a touch-down
by a tackler you hadn't
realized was anywhere near!</p>

<p>Jones pushed forward, chewing
agitatedly on his cigar. "Edward,
you've got some nerve,
pulling a stunt like this! It's an
outrage!"</p>

<p>"Take it easy," I said weakly.
"Something's gone wrong."</p>

<p>"It certainly has. You must
have gone insane!"</p>

<p>"Listen here! If you don't stick
with me on this, I'm all through
with the paper!"</p>

<p>"That suits me fine!"</p>

<p>I watched him leave, trailing
cigar smoke. The others followed.
My face burned and sweat
trickled down my back and along
my sides. I wanted to hit out at
something....</p>

<p>A hand gripped my elbow. It
was Sergeant Thompson. "Mr.
Potter, you shouldn't let this get
you down. People's kids get in
scrapes all the time. Tomorrow
you'll have a talk with the judge
and everything will turn out
okay."</p>

<p>I jerked my elbow away. "In
other words, you think I'm batty,
too!"</p>

<p>"No," he said, gripping my elbow
again and starting me toward
the door. "It's been hot and
you just need some rest."</p>

<p>"Thompson," I said, dragging
myself to a halt, "I know it
sounds nuts, but this Ashe character
really exists. Help me find
him and you can cut yourself a
slice. It'll be big time!"</p>

<p>The grip on my elbow increased.
"Go home, Mr. Potter,
and get a good night's sleep."</p>

<p>"But it's on the level, Thompson.
Jones and I busted up. I'm
playing on your team now!"</p>

<p>His face got all flushed. "My
job isn't a game and I don't belong
to any team. Get wise, will
you? Stay in your own back
yard for once. It could stand a
lot of weeding!" He pushed me
out the door then&mdash;so hard, I
almost fell.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<div class="cap">STANDING there, feeling the
heat press in on me, I tried
to dope out the next move. My
car was still at Jones' place, so
I'd need a cab. I turned toward
the drugstore at the end of the
block where I could phone. Walking
along, I recalled Ashe had
taken a cab earlier in the evening.
If I could talk to the driver, I
might get a lead on his whereabouts.
I walked faster.</div>

<p>I thought of Thompson and
his remark about the back yard
... and the weeds. Again, for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
third time, a chill traveled the
length of my spine. I began to
run. I ran past the drugstore and
all the way home.</p>

<p>They were both in the bedroom.
Nan stood in the far corner
with her back against the wall.
Her shoulders were scratched
and her lip cut. She held a heavy
bookend poised to strike at Ashe,
who was in front of her, moving
stealthily forward.</p>

<p>The moment I spun him
around, I froze in amazement. I
couldn't recognize him. Then, all
at once, I realized I was looking
at the spitting image of myself.</p>

<p>He broke from my grasp and
darted to the window. Before I
could follow, Nan had dropped
the bookend and flung herself
into my arms. "Oh, Ted," she
sobbed, "I <i>knew</i> it wasn't you!"</p>

<p>I kissed her and gently disengaged
her arms. "I've got to get
Ashe," I said.</p>

<p>When I vaulted through the
window and circled the house, I
spotted him rushing down the
street. I caught him around the
corner at the same spot where
I'd first seen him.</p>

<p>I slugged him. Yet I knew it
was useless the instant the blow
landed. He felt just like sponge
rubber. But I kept hitting him.
I didn't bother listening to his
cries and I didn't give a damn
that he'd changed himself back
to an old man.</p>

<p>The blow on the back of my
neck was so sudden, I didn't feel
it. The only sensation was unbalance,
as if I were walking uphill.
Then I was slapped with the
sidewalk.</p>

<p>Looking up, I could see he was
young, clean-cut and well built.
His long, horsy face was furious.
"You crazy?" he yelled. "Beating
up an old man!"</p>

<p>I searched desperately for an
explanation&mdash;something to say.
Then, abruptly, without having
uttered a sound, I reeled away
and shambled hurriedly down
the street ... home, to Nan.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
